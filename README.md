Bob needs your help again!
After your sterling work creating the basket system for Bob's Bagels, you've managed to land some more work with him!

This time he'd like you to start to create a website for him - nothing fancy, just using simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript! (Do not use any additional libraries or external services!)

Requirement 1:
As a user, I'd like to see a landing page when I get to Bob's Bagels home page, so that I can see some information about Bob's Bagels and navigate to other areas of the site

Requirement 2:
As a user, on the landing page, I'd like to see a slideshow of bagel images so that I can see what products they sell
